                <h1>Advantages of using Linux</h1>
                <h2>Performance and Stability</h2>
                <p>Linux is widely recognized for its exceptional performance and stability. Unlike many operating systems that can slow down over time, Linux remains responsive even on older hardware. This makes it a viable option for users who want to revitalize computers that can no longer keep up with modern software requirements.</p>
                <h2>Enhanced Security</h2>
                <p>Enhanced security in Linux is one of the most valued features by users and system administrators. This operating system is designed with robust security measures that make it less vulnerable to attacks and malware compared to other systems.</p>
                <h2>Updates and Community Support</h2>
                <p>Linux is constantly updated by developers around the world, ensuring that the latest security patches and performance improvements are always available. Additionally, the Linux user community is very active, providing support and resources that help solve problems quickly.</p>
                <h2>Great for Programming</h2>
                <p>For developers, Linux is practically a “playground.” It offers a powerful terminal, native support for languages like Python, Java, Node.js, and modern tools like Docker, Git, and Kubernetes. Moreover, since many servers run Linux, working on it makes configuring production environments easier. For anyone wanting to learn programming professionally, it’s a perfect platform./p>

            <h1>Why should I use Linux today?</h1>
            <p>When you start using Linux, you notice something few systems provide: the feeling of total control. Every detail of your computer responds exactly to what you want, without intermediaries or artificial limitations. It’s an experience that transforms your relationship with technology; suddenly, you’re not just using a computer, you’re shaping your own digital space.</p>
            <p>And there’s something addictive about it. Solving a problem, adjusting a setting, or simply organizing your environment the way it makes sense to you brings satisfaction that goes far beyond functionality. Every small adjustment becomes an achievement, and every challenge teaches something new. It’s continuous learning that never tires, because each day you discover new possibilities, new ways to do the same things better.</p>

            <p class="pabaixovideo">"Deep down, there’s a freedom that no other system provides in the same way. You decide what enters, what leaves, what changes, and what stays. It’s not just about technology; it’s about feeling that you truly understand and master what’s in front of you. And when that happens, working, studying, or simply browsing the computer ceases to be an obligation and becomes genuine pleasure. I love the penguin." - John Luke HayDay</p>
